# Malaria-Detection
The CNN model employs deep learning and image analysis techniques to automatically extract relevant features from cell images, enabling precise classification. With a high accuracy of around 95%, the model demonstrates its effectiveness in distinguishing between infected and uninfected cells. <br> 

The architecture consists of convolutional layers for detecting local patterns, pooling layers for dimension reduction, and fully connected layers for integrating high-level features. Batch normalization is applied to stabilize and improve model performance. After training with a large labeled dataset, the model achieves optimal parameter configuration through backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms.
